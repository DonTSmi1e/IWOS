## Problems
- IWFS (i wanna fat12, but not today)
- 16-bit mode
- No C/C++
- No kernel API (or something that programs can use to print/load file/etc)

## Building
**WSL 2.0 supported**

Requirements:
- NASM
- Make
- QEMU
```bash
make clean      # Delete bin/ and disk.img
make build      # Build project
make run        # Run disk.img in QEMU (qemu-system-i386)

make clean run  # Just build and run OS.
```
